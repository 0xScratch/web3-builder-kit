# Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to the **Web3 Builder Kit**! ðŸŽ‰

It means a lot when you help us improve the content and resources for the community to lift builders/hackers up by equipping them with the right tools and knowledge.

This guide aims to provide you with the necessary information to make your contribution process smooth and effective. Please read it carefully before you start contributing.

## Getting Started

### Adding a New Resource/Category

This is probably the most common theme of contribution. If you have a resource/tool/service that you believe would benefit developers working in the space, it will be a great addition to the repository. But there are a few things to keep in mind before adding a new resource:

- **Check for Duplicates**: Before adding a new resource, please make sure that it doesn't already exist in the repository. You can use the search bar at the top of the repository to look for similar resources.
- **Clear Understanding**: Make sure you have a clear understanding of what the tool/service is about, its key features, etc. In other words, you must know what you are doing as it won't be just a contribution but a responsibility to provide correct information to the community.
- **Right Format**: Follow the format of the existing resources that been already added to the repository. One such reference is [here](./dev-resources/attestations/eas.md). Still, let me include the format that's been advisable to follow:

    1. **Overview**: A brief description of what the tool/service is about with the website link attached in the name. Try to keep it easily understandable and to the point, as most of the developers won't be familiar with the tool/service.
    2. **Table of Contents**: This will help the reader to navigate through the resource easily.
    3. **Key Features**: List out the key features of the tool/service which are easy to understand and provide a clear picture of what the tool/service is capable of.
    4. **Use Cases**: Mention some of the use cases of the tool/service which will help the reader to understand the practical applications of the tool/service. Although, in some cases this section might not be applicable as both key features and use cases might overlap. Thus, make a wise choice.
    5. **How It Works** *(Optional)*: If you think it's necessary to explain how the tool/service works, you can include this section. This will help the reader to understand the working of the tool/service in a better way.
    6. **References and Links**: Provide a list of references and links for further exploration. This will help the reader to dive deeper into the tool/service if they are interested. Try not flooding out the section with unnecessary links, keep it minimal and useful.
    7. **README Contributors**: This section is to give credit to the contributors who have added the resource to the repository. It's always good to give credit where it's due.
    8. **Any Additional Sections**: If you think there are any additional sections that need to be included, feel free to add them. But make sure they are relevant and provide value to the reader.

- **Use AI Smartly**: It's obvious that many contributors will be using AI tools to generate the content for the respective resource. That's acceptable but make sure to review the content before submitting the PR.
- **Commit Message**: While making a commit, make sure to provide a clear and concise commit message that explains what changes you have made. This will help the maintainers to understand the purpose of the commit.
- **Learn**: The main motive of contributing is to learn and share knowledge. So, avoid copy-pasting the content from other sources without understanding it at all as this won't help you at the core level. Contribute and level up your skillset.

### Updating an Existing Resource/Category

- **Check for Updates**: Before updating an existing resource, please make sure that the information you are adding is up-to-date and relevant. If the tool/service has been updated or there are new features, feel free to update the resource.
- **Correct Mistakes**: If you find any mistakes in the existing resource, such as broken links, incorrect information, etc., you can update the resource to correct them.
- **Open Issues**: If you find any issues related to the existing resource, you can open an issue in the repository to discuss it with the maintainers and other contributors.

### Creating a Pull Request

- **Check for Existing PRs**: Before creating a new pull request, please check if there is already an existing pull request for the same resource. If there is, you can collaborate with the existing contributor to improve the resource.
- **Fork-Pull Workflow**: Make sure to fork the repository and create a new branch for your contribution. Once you have made the necessary changes, you can create a pull request to the main repository.
- **Make it detailed**: While creating a pull request, make sure to provide a right title and detailed description of the changes/additions you have made. Try to provide the right links/resources that you have referred to while making the contribution. This will help the maintainers to understand your contribution better and merge it quickly.
- **Link to Issue**: If you are creating a pull request for an existing issue, make sure to link the issue in the pull request description.
- **Avoid Multiple Contributions**: It's always good to make a single contribution in a pull request. This will help the maintainers to review the contribution easily and provide feedback if necessary.

**Note: Pull Requests with "*No description*" provided will be closed immediately. This is to save the time of maintainers and contributors.**

### Issues

- **Open Issues**: If you find any issues related to the repository, such as broken links, incorrect information, etc., you can open an issue in the repository to discuss it with the maintainers and other contributors if necessary.
- **Solve Issues**: Scan through the existing issues in the repository to find one that interests you. If a contributor is working on the issue, they will be assigned to it. If not, you can assign yourself to the issue and start working on it.

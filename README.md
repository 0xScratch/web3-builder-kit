## What was the need?

- The blockchain ecosystem is vast and ever-evolving, with new tools and technologies being introduced regularly. For developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps) or explore blockchain development, it can be challenging to navigate this landscape and identify the most suitable resources for their projects.
- Hackathons are a great way for developers to showcase their skills, learn new technologies, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. However, the time constraints and competitive nature of hackathons require participants to have access to curated resources and tools that can help them build innovative projects quickly and efficiently. That's how the Web3 Builder Kit was born!

## What one can expect?

- There are vast number of categories that are covered in this repository and this number will definitely increase with time.
- Within each resource, one gets to understand **what the tool/service is about**, its **key-features**, some of the **use cases** which will help in understanding the practical applications of the tool/service, and a **list of references and links** for further exploration.

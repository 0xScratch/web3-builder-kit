# Blockless

[Blockless](https://blockless.network/) is a decentralized platform designed to launch, secure, and integrate [Network Neutral Applications (nnApps)](https://blockless.network/docs/protocol/core-concepts#network-neutral-applications-nnapps) at remarkable speeds. It aims to free applications from the limitations of traditional blockchain networks, allowing them to operate independently and efficiently. By utilizing a modular architecture, Blockless enables developers to select the best consensus mechanisms and dynamically allocate resources based on their application's needs.

## Key Features

- **Modular Application Architecture**: Blockless pioneers the modular application paradigm in Web3, allowing decentralized applications to run on specialized networks optimized for specific workloads while leveraging blockchain for authentication, value transfer, and system trust.
- **Network Neutrality**: nnApps built on Blockless can operate across various L1/L2 blockchain networks without being constrained by the limitations of any particular blockchain, such as latency, cost, or smart contract capabilities.
- **Dynamic Consensus and Verification**: Blockless enables applications to select the most efficient consensus and verification algorithms for each workload, ensuring optimal performance and security.
- **Automated Orchestration**: Workloads deployed on Blockless are matched and distributed to the most suitable nodes using advanced selection and distribution algorithms, ensuring efficient execution for nnApps.
- **WebAssembly (WASM) and WASI**: Blockless leverages WASM and the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) to enable the efficient execution of complex applications in a decentralized and trustless manner, ensuring fast, secure, and scalable performance.
- **Blockless Runtime**: The lightweight and efficient Blockless Runtime is built on WASM technology, supporting various programming languages and providing a secure and scalable serverless computing environment.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Blockless ensures the reliable operation of nnApps through redundancy, replication, load balancing, and automatic recovery, maintaining application availability and responsiveness even in the face of failures or disruptions.
- **Distributed Orchestration**: The platform's distributed orchestration mechanisms efficiently allocate and manage resources, execute tasks, and ensure nnApp workloads are executed correctly and consistently across the entire network.

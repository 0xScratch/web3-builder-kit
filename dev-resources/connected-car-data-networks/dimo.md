# DIMO

[DIMO](https://dimo.org/) (pronounced "Dee-Moe") is an innovative platform that makes every car smart and programmable, enhancing the driving experience for both individual drivers and fleets. It provides an open framework for connecting vehicles to various applications and services, allowing access to valuable data such as speed, location, and engine diagnostics. By leveraging blockchain technology, DIMO ensures privacy and security while enabling users to control their vehicle information and earn rewards for sharing data. The platform supports cars from 2008 or newer in select regions, aiming to redefine car ownership through a more connected and rewarding relationship between drivers and their vehicles.

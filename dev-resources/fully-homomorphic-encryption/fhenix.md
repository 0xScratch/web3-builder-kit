# Fhenix

[Fhenix](https://www.fhenix.io/) is the first Layer 2 protocol on Ethereum that integrates [Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)](https://docs.fhenix.zone/docs/devdocs/Fhenix%20Testnet/Fhenix-T-FHE#fhe---fully-homomorphic-encryption) to provide on-chain confidentiality. This innovative approach allows developers to perform computations on encrypted data without ever needing to decrypt it, thereby enhancing privacy and security in blockchain applications. By extending Ethereum's capabilities, Fhenix aims to create a more secure environment for smart contracts and transactions, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected throughout its lifecycle.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: The protocol is designed with a modular structure, allowing for flexibility and easy integration of various components, such as the Core Chain, FheOS, and Warp-Drive, which can be adapted based on evolving needs.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Fhenix is fully compatible with Ethereum's virtual machine (EVM), allowing developers to use familiar tools like Solidity without needing to learn new programming languages.
- **Optimistic Rollup Structure**: This design choice enhances scalability and privacy by allowing transactions to be processed off-chain while maintaining security through fraud proofs.
- **Coprocessor Integration**: Fhenix supports FHE coprocessors, which offload specific computational tasks from the main chain, improving efficiency while ensuring robust security.

## Use Cases

1. **Confidential Voting**: Fhenix allows for secure, anonymous voting in decentralized organizations (DAOs) and governmental elections, ensuring voter privacy while maintaining the integrity and validity of each vote.
2. **Confidential Gaming**: The protocol supports private gaming applications, such as poker, where players' hands and actions remain hidden from others, preserving the game's integrity and confidentiality.
3. **Private Auctions**: Fhenix facilitates on-chain auctions that keep bids encrypted until the auction concludes, protecting bidder identities and ensuring fair competition without exposing sensitive information.
4. **Secure Data Sharing**: Organizations can utilize Fhenix to share sensitive data securely on public blockchains, enabling compliance with privacy regulations while still allowing computations on that data.

# Inco

[Inco](https://www.inco.org/) is a modular confidential computing Layer-1 blockchain that enhances privacy and security within the Web3 ecosystem. By utilizing [fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)](https://docs.inco.org/inco-protocol/fully-homomorphic-encryption), Inco enables the creation of private smart contracts and allows computations on encrypted data without requiring decryption. This innovative approach not only secures existing Ethereum networks but also facilitates interoperability with other blockchains, positioning Inco as a significant player in advancing decentralized applications while ensuring user confidentiality.

## Why should one use Inco?

- **Fully On-Chain Encrypted States:** Inco enables composable and programmable applications with encrypted data directly on the blockchain, eliminating the need for off-chain storage.
- **Enhanced Privacy for Multi-Party Interactions:** Unlike zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography, which can struggle with multi-party scenarios, Inco facilitates secure interactions in applications like card games and private voting.
- **Simplified Development Process:** Developers can easily implement confidentiality features using familiar tools and languages, such as Solidity, without needing to understand complex circuit creation.
- **Reduced Dependencies and Centralization:** By keeping all confidential data on-chain, Inco minimizes reliance on third parties, enhancing security and decentralization.
- **Unlocking New Use Cases:** The integration of fully homomorphic encryption allows for innovative applications that were previously challenging or impossible with existing EVM and ZK tools.

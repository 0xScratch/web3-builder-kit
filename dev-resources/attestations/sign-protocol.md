# Sign Protocol

[Sign Protocol](https://sign.global/) is a blockchain-based system that allows users to easily verify and attest information across multiple chains. It replaces traditional, often cumbersome methods of proving authenticity with a streamlined, digital approach. By using advanced technologies like cryptography and digital signatures, Sign Protocol ensures that claims and data can be trusted and validated quickly and securely, making it easier for everyone to confirm the accuracy of information online and in real-world applications.

## Key Features

- **Omni-Chain Compatibility:** Sign Protocol operates independently of any specific blockchain, making it versatile and portable across various blockchain environments, including Ethereum, EVM-based chains, TON, and Solana.
- **Schema Registry:** Provides a centralized hub for creating, storing, and referencing schemas, which define the structure and standards for making verifiable attestations.
- **Digital Signatures:** Uses cryptographic digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of attestations, allowing for secure verification of claims.
- **Hybrid Attestations**: Store attestation data off-chain on Arweave or IPFS while keeping metadata and schema on-chain. This approach reduces gas fees and improves data retrieval efficiency by using Content IDs (CIDs) for quick access.
- **Open Source and Community Driven:** Embraces an open-source approach, encouraging public contributions and feedback to continually enhance the protocol. Developers and non-developers alike can engage through various channels and contribute to its growth.

## Use Cases

Most of the use cases for Sign Protocol are similar to Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). Thus, it's advised to check them out [here](https://github.com/0xScratch/web3-builder-kit/blob/main/dev-resources/attestations/eas.md#use-cases)

# Substrate (Polkadot SDK)

[Substrate](https://substrate.io/) is a powerful Software Development Kit (SDK) designed for building application-specific blockchains. Developed by [Parity Technologies](https://www.parity.io/), it leverages Rust-based libraries to provide a modular and [flexible](https://substrate.io/technology/flexible/) framework, allowing developers to create blockchains that can operate independently or as part of the Polkadot ecosystem, benefiting from shared security. With Substrate, users can select from a library of pre-built modules called [pallets](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/glossary/#pallet), which simplify the development process by providing reusable components for common blockchain functionalities like governance and asset management. If existing modules don't meet specific needs, developers can [create custom pallets](https://docs.substrate.io/build/custom-pallets/), enabling them to innovate and tailor their blockchain solutions effectively. This adaptability, combined with features like forkless upgrades and [cross-chain interoperability](https://substrate.io/technology/interoperable/), makes Substrate an ideal choice for rapidly developing robust and future-proof blockchain applications.

## Key Features

**Open Source:** Substrate is an open-source framework, providing free access to a vast codebase utilized by leading industry teams, fostering innovation and collaboration within the community12.
**Future-Proof:** Designed to be adaptable, Substrate allows developers to easily evolve their blockchains in response to technological advancements and changing requirements23.
**Multichain Capabilities:** It enables the creation of multiple interconnected blockchains, allowing them to function together seamlessly within the Polkadot ecosystem34.
**Interoperability:** By utilizing the Polkadot Relay Chain, Substrate facilitates seamless communication between different chains, eliminating the need for bridges and enhancing cross-chain interactions12.
**Shared Security:** All chains connected to Polkadot benefit from shared security, reducing the need for individual security measures and enhancing overall network safety34.
**Sovereign Governance:** Each blockchain maintains its own governance structure while benefiting from the collective advantages of the Polkadot network

## Key Features

- **EVM Compatibility**: As a fork of the Binance Smart Chain, Chiliz Chain is fully compatible with Ethereum's tooling. This allows developers familiar with Ethereum to easily build and deploy applications on the Chiliz Chain, leveraging existing knowledge and resources.
- **Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) Consensus**: Chiliz Chain employs a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines Proof of Authority (PoA) and Proof of Stake (PoS). This approach enables faster block times (approximately 3 seconds) and lower transaction fees, although it does limit decentralization by utilizing a fixed number of validators.
- **Limited Number of Validators**: The network operates with a set of 11 validators, which are selected based on their staking power. This structure helps maintain network security while promoting community governance.
- **Native Token (CHZ)**: CHZ serves as the native token for the Chiliz Chain, functioning similarly to ETH on Ethereum. It is used for transaction fees, deploying smart contracts, and securing the network through staking. Additionally, it facilitates cross-chain operations, allowing users to transfer assets between Chiliz Chain and Ethereum.
- **High Transaction Capacity**: The Chiliz Chain can handle approximately 400 transactions per second (TPS), making it suitable for high-demand applications in the sports and entertainment industries.

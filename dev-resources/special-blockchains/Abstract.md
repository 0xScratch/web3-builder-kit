# Abstract

[Abstract](https://abs.xyz/en) is an innovative Layer 2 (L2) network built on Ethereum, designed to enhance the scalability and efficiency of blockchain applications. By utilizing [zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/) technology, Abstract processes transactions off-chain and then bundles them for verification on the Ethereum mainnet. This approach significantly reduces transaction costs and increases speed, making it ideal for consumer-facing applications. Abstract is compatible with Ethereum's existing smart contracts, allowing developers to easily migrate their projects with minimal adjustments. With its focus on user experience and community engagement, Abstract aims to create a more accessible and efficient blockchain environment for both developers and users.

## Key Features

- **Layer 2 Scalability**: Abstract operates as a Layer 2 network on Ethereum, enabling faster transactions and lower fees by processing transactions off-chain and verifying them on the Ethereum mainnet using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs.
- **EVM Compatibility**: It is compatible with Ethereum's existing smart contracts, allowing developers to easily port their applications with minimal changes, thus facilitating a smoother transition to the Abstract platform.
- **Abstract Global Wallet (AGW)**: This is a cross-application smart contract wallet that simplifies user onboarding. Users can sign up using familiar methods like email or social accounts, allowing them to interact with any application on Abstract seamlessly.
- **Native Account Abstraction:** All accounts on Abstract are smart contract accounts by default, allowing smart contracts to initiate transactions and enabling enhanced security options like recovery mechanisms and spending limits.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: The platform focuses on a consumer-centric approach, streamlining onboarding processes and improving app discoverability to make blockchain technology more accessible.
- **Low Transaction Fees**: By utilizing ZK rollup technology, Abstract significantly reduces transaction costs, making it more economical for users and developers alike.

## Use Cases

1. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Abstract can enhance DeFi platforms by providing faster and cheaper transactions, enabling users to trade, lend, and borrow assets more efficiently.
2. **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**: NFT marketplaces can utilize Abstract to reduce minting and transaction costs, making it more economical for users to create, buy, and sell NFTs.
3. **Gaming**: Blockchain-based games can benefit from Abstract's low latency and high throughput, facilitating real-time gameplay and enabling microtransactions without the burden of high fees.
4. **Cross-Application Interactions**: With the [Abstract Global Wallet (AGW)](https://docs.abs.xyz/abstract-global-wallet/overview#what-is-abstract-global-wallet) and [native account abstraction](https://docs.abs.xyz/how-abstract-works/native-account-abstraction/overview), users can seamlessly interact with various applications on the platform, enhancing user experience and engagement.
5. **Gasless Transactions**: Abstract allows for gas sponsorship, where third parties can cover transaction fees for users, making it easier for newcomers to engage with blockchain applications without worrying about costs.

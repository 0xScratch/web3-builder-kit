# Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) is a powerful web3 development platform designed to simplify and enhance the process of building decentralized applications (dApps) on blockchain networks. It offers a suite of tools including a multichain [Node RPC](https://tenderly.co/web3-gateway), [smart contract debugging](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger), [gas profiling](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger/gas-profiler), and a [simulator for testing transactions](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulations) before deployment. With features like [Virtual TestNets](https://tenderly.co/virtual-testnets) and [real-time alerting](https://tenderly.co/alerting) for on-chain events, Tenderly provides developers with the infrastructure needed to efficiently develop, monitor, and optimize their smart contracts, ultimately improving the overall user experience in dApp development.

## Key Features

- **Virtual Testnets**: Customizable mainnet replicas for collaborative development, testing, and staging of decentralized applications (dApps).
- **Unlimited Faucet**: Instantly fund ERC-20 and native balances in Virtual Testnets.
- **Node RPC**: Access multiple blockchains via RPC, allowing for transaction simulations and queries.
- **Debugger**: Find and fix transaction errors quickly using an interactive debugging tool.
- **Simulation API**: Simulate transactions to get accurate insights into performance and potential issues.
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Monitor on-chain events and transactions with customizable alerts and notifications.
- **Contract Verification**: Verify smart contracts privately or publicly using tools like Foundry and Hardhat.
- **Web3 Actions**: Implement serverless backends for on-chain events using JavaScript, simplifying event handling.
- **Gas Profiler**: Obtain precise estimates of gas usage for transactions.
- **Developer Explorer**: Tools for analyzing transaction execution and managing wallets and contracts.
- **Alerting Webhooks**: Send alert data to various external services like Telegram, Slack, or email based on on-chain events.
- **State Overrides**: Override account balances and smart contract variables to simulate non-existing conditions.
- **Client Libraries**: Integrate easily with libraries like viem or ethers in your development workflows.
- **Sandbox Environment**: Develop contracts and run transactions on Forks from any web browser for experimentation.

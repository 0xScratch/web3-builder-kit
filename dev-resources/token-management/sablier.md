# Sablier

[Sablier](https://sablier.com/) is a pioneering token distribution protocol built on Ethereum that enables real-time, by-the-second payments for cryptocurrencies, particularly ERC-20 tokens. Launched in 2019, it utilizes a set of immutable smart contracts to facilitate continuous [asset streaming](https://docs.sablier.com/concepts/protocol/streaming), allowing users to receive payments incrementally rather than in lump sums. This method enhances financial flexibility and reduces reliance on intermediaries, promoting a permissionless environment where anyone can create and manage payment streams without restrictions, making it an innovative solution in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.

## Key Features

- **Custom Distributions:** Users can create various distribution models, including linear streams, cliffs, monthly unlocks, discrete unlocks, and timelocks, allowing for tailored payment schedules to meet specific needs.
- **Bulk Streams:** The protocol enables the creation of multiple payment streams simultaneously, streamlining processes for payroll, airdrops, and other distributions, saving time and effort.
- **NFT Hourglass:** Each payment stream is represented as an ERC-721 NFT owned by the recipient. This feature allows streams to be used as collateral in lending protocols, integrating Sablier into the broader DeFi ecosystem.
- **Permissionless Access:** Sablier is decentralized and permissionless, granting users complete control over their funds without the need for intermediaries. Only the sender and recipient manage the streamed assets.
- **Security and Auditing:** The protocol has undergone extensive testing and audits by multiple security firms, ensuring its robustness and reliability. Since its launch in 2019, Sablier has maintained a strong security record with no incidents reported.

## Use Cases

1. **Vesting:** Automates the token vesting process, allowing gradual release over time, reducing manual effort and errors.
2. **Payroll:** Enables real-time salary streaming, providing immediate access to earnings and enhancing employee satisfaction.
3. **Airdrops:** Streams tokens gradually to recipients, encouraging long-term engagement and reducing immediate sell-offs.
4. **Grants:** Efficiently distributes grants over time, ensuring accountability and allowing for stream cancellation if needed.
5. **Bulk Streams:** Facilitates the creation of multiple payment streams at once, simplifying administration for organizations.

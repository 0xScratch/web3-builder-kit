[Hedgey](https://hedgey.finance/) is a token vesting platform designed to assist decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and on-chain entities in efficiently distributing tokens to their teams, contributors, investors, and communities. By leveraging on-chain, programmatic token releases, Hedgey combines features like token streams and periodic release schedules with administrative controls such as revocability and governance rights. This allows organizations to automate and secure their token distribution processes. Hedgey has collaborated with notable projects like Arbitrum DAO and Gnosis, providing a user-friendly self-service platform that empowers on-chain teams to manage their operations effectively and with minimal effort. Ultimately, Hedgey aims to equip every on-chain organization with the essential tools needed for growth and success.

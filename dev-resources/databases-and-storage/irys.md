# Irys

[Irys](https://irys.xyz/) is the first Layer 1 programmable [datachain](https://docs.irys.xyz/learn/learn-about-irys/what-is-datachain), designed to enhance how data is stored and executed on the blockchain. By integrating storage and execution, Irys allows developers to create innovative applications that can interact with real-time data directly on-chain, significantly expanding the range of web services that can be built. This unified platform addresses critical issues in current data storage solutions, such as inefficiency, complexity, and high costs, making it easier for developers to build scalable and decentralized applications. Ultimately, Irys aims to unlock the full potential of on-chain data, fostering a more robust and versatile blockchain ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Ledger System**: Irys utilizes a [dual-ledger](https://docs.irys.xyz/learn/protocol/ledgers) architecture, comprising a Submit Ledger for temporary data storage and a Publish Ledger for verified, permanent data. This ensures data integrity and enhances security by only allowing verified data to be stored permanently.
- **Programmable Data Integration**: By merging data storage with execution capabilities via the [IrysVM](https://docs.irys.xyz/learn/why-build-on-irys/irysvm), Irys enables real-time interaction with on-chain data, allowing smart contracts to access and manipulate data directly.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to handle growing data demands efficiently without sacrificing performance or increasing costs, making it suitable for various applications.
- **Transparent Pricing**: Irys offers predictable and stable costs for transactions and data storage, simplifying budgeting and planning for developers.
- **Decentralization and Security**: A hybrid consensus mechanism combining Proof of Work and Proof of Stake incentivizes miners to accurately store data, reducing centralization risks and enhancing network reliability.

## Use Cases

1. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Irys can facilitate complex financial contracts that settle instantly based on live market data, enhancing the efficiency of DeFi applications.
2. **Real-Time Data Applications**: Developers can create applications that respond instantly to changes in on-chain data, such as social networks that update content dynamically or AI models that adjust based on new information.
3. **Data Provenance Solutions**: Irys can support applications requiring secure and immutable records of data origins, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness across various sectors.
4. **NFTs and Digital Collectibles**: The platform can enable innovative NFT applications that require real-time interactions with on-chain data, enhancing user experiences in digital art and collectibles.
5. **Supply Chain Management**: Irys can streamline the tracking of goods through decentralized applications that verify each step in the supply chain using immutable on-chain records.

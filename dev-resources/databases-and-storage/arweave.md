# Arweave

[Arweave](https://arweave.org/) is a pioneering protocol that enables permanent data storage, allowing users to preserve information indefinitely with a single, one-time payment. It operates on a decentralized network of miners who secure and replicate data in exchange for AR token rewards, ensuring long-term accessibility backed by a sustainable funding model. Arweave hosts the [permaweb](https://2hsfyi4t5fiqdcanybdez4e4admrjeqghts22viz7uuo3d5k2nna.arweave.net/0eRcI5PpUQGIDcBGTPCcANkUkgY85a1VGf0o7Y-q01o/#/en/the-permaweb), an expansive digital realm where web applications and pages exist permanently without centralized control, promoting free speech and preserving history and culture. With a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, Arweave empowers developers to create fully decentralized applications, fostering innovation and collaboration in building a freer internet.
